## **Why TeamX Came to our  mind?**

There are countless students out there brimming with next-level ideas and the capacity to tackle real-world challenges. However, a common hurdle they face is translating these ideas into reality â€“ a significant challenge often lies in assembling the right team to collaborate with. This obstacle is particularly pronounced in fields like research and tech startups, where teamwork is of paramount importance. Many of these students possess valuable skills and are eager to volunteer their time, share their knowledge, and contribute to meaningful projects. Unfortunately, they frequently find themselves at a loss when searching for the ideal platform to do so.

This problem is a big issue for students applying to college and those who are really passionate about what they want to do. It's disheartening because sometimes, when organizations do provide opportunities, they charge extremely high fees that many students can't afford.

## **Solution Is TeamX**

I am currently in the process of developing a non-profit web application called "TeamX," precisely designed to tackle these challenges head-on and provide a solution. Our mission is clear: to open up a world of opportunities for these individuals, enabling them to connect with like-minded peers, collaborate on exciting projects, and share their expertise without the financial burden.
